# Todo 
just a list of things todo haha 




- [ ] make a public repo for megaultraheavy stuff cuz i just wanna see if i can play music in VT haha\
- [ ] pitch an idea to legendile to make a THE FINALS COMMUNITY CODERS GitHub organization for all the:\
A. "no more time" community projects.\
B. mentioning other community projects with links in the README.\
goal: allowing outside THE FINALS fans to fix/modify/add/improve to deprecated projects, and/or bringing attention to still active self owned projects.\
additiobal idea: if a project is "no more time" deprecated, and if the original project owner agrees, it can be merged into THE FINALS COMMUNITY CODERS group for a type of "community fueled revival", and adopt the TFCC "policy of community work, respect and honour"\
that basically is a large term notice saying somthing about "please respect the original project owner, please respect the goal of community work," ext ext,\
and also saying somthing about, license variety per original owner choice and "do not redistribute and reformat in your own image" kinda thing.
